Shoot-em up game, made on cpp with sdl2.

## Building
You will need SDL2, SDL2 image and SDL2 TTF (ttf is not being used currently, but eventually it should). This one can be installed with your package manager on linux. God knows how to do that on windows (i've tried).
I will _eventually_ do what's it's needed for Windows.

Moreover, Nuklear it's needed for the editor GUI. Create a folder called 'deps' and just git clone Nuklear on there.

I'm compiling with GCC on Fedora 40.
